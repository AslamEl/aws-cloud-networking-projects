# 🔐 Project 2 – VPC Traffic Flow and Security

This project focuses on controlling and securing traffic in and out of your AWS resources using route tables, security groups, and network ACLs.

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

- **Configured a Route Table** to direct traffic from a public subnet through an Internet Gateway  
- **Set up a Security Group** to control access to EC2 instances based on IP, port, and protocol  
- **Implemented Network ACLs** (Access Control Lists) to filter inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level

- Differences between Security Groups and Network ACLs  
- Importance of rule order, stateless vs stateful filtering  
- How route tables interact with subnets and gateways
