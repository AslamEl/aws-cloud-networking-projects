# 🌐 Project 1 – Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

This project focuses on creating and configuring a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** to understand IP networking and cloud resource isolation inside AWS.

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

- **Created a Virtual Private Cloud** with a custom IPv4 CIDR block  
- **Set up a public subnet** that auto-assigns public IPs to EC2 instances  
- **Attached an Internet Gateway** to allow internet access for public resources  
- **Updated the route table** to route internet traffic via the IGW

## 🌟 Key Learnings

> Building a VPC from scratch gave me a solid understanding of network segmentation, routing, and internet access in AWS.

- CIDR block planning and subnet creation  
- Internet Gateway setup and route table configuration  
- Concepts like public IP auto-assign, default VPC vs custom VPC
