# 🔒 Project 3 – Creating a Private Subnet

This project focused on isolating resources in a **private subnet** within an Amazon VPC to enhance security and restrict public internet access.

---

## ✅ What I Accomplished

- **Created a private subnet** within the VPC  
- Ensured **CIDR block isolation** to avoid conflicts with public subnets  
- Configured a **dedicated route table** without routes to an Internet Gateway  
- Set up a **Network ACL** that denies all inbound and outbound traffic by default

## 🌟 Key Learnings

> Building a private subnet helped me understand network isolation and security best practices in AWS.

- Subnet CIDR planning for public vs private  
- Route table management for controlled traffic flow  
- Network ACLs to enforce subnet-level security
